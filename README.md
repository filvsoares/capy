# Capy Programming Language

### [See demo!](https://filvsoares.github.io/capy/)

Capy is a high-level, strongly-typed, interpreted, custom programming language I am developing mostly with TypeScript as a pet project.

### But why?

As a professional software developer, I often get asked by people what software code looks on practice, and how it works.

If I'm close to my computer, I can open a powerful IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code and explain them something, maybe even write a "Hello world" or a boring algorithm to get prime numbers or whatever.

But I cannot seem to transmit any enthusiasm to them by showing some calculations on a terminal window, and anything beyond that would require massive amounts of code that would quickly set them running away. Even in the case they get interested, the sole process of downloading and setting up a free IDE with which they can experiment and run code step by step is not trivial.

All of this is a shame, since knowing how to write code is a very powerful asset for professional opportunities, developing innovative products, and even creating art.

I myself may have only followed this path because I stumbled upon Delphi 5 while using a computer at school as a kid, which made it really fun and easy to create some mini apps and have them running with a few lines of code.


Obviously I'm not getting anywhere near that with this small project, but nevertheless I want to:

- Create a simple but complete programming language, that won't be too daunting to understand, but also still close to "common" languages (i.e. no trying to imitate natural language);
- Create an interpreter for it that runs locally on the browser (i.e. with TypeScript) and allows running step by step and thoroughly inspecting its variables, stack, etc.
- Design a sketchpad UI to allow experimenting with the language;
- Develop some fun libraries for it to allow creating simple games, simple UIs, etc. with few lines of code.

Additionally, for my own research and for those who already know how to code:

- Learn/share how to create a custom programming language, from the tokenizer to the interpreter;
- Experiment with architecture patterns to create a clean, pluggable, extensible and reusable project.

_This project is in a very initial phase and this very README is still being written, so come back soon for new developments!_
